        <h1 class="title2">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p class="about">Moneyflow is designed to help users gain financial awareness by analyzing their daily, monthly, and yearly income and expenses. With its user-friendly interface, it provides easy access to essential financial insights, such as daily spending limits, income and expense trends compared to previous periods, and expenditure distributionâ€”all in a single view. The app aims to make financial management more accessible and comprehensible through advanced visualizations and mathematical analysis. <br> <br>
            This Privacy Policy describes how Moneyflow ("we", "us", "our" or "Moneyflow") collects, uses and shares your personal information when you use our mobile application ("Application"). By using Moneyflow, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Information You Provide:</strong> Moneyflow does not collect, request, or store any personal information, including but not limited to your first name, last name, phone number, email address, salary, or expense details. The app operates entirely offline, ensuring your financial data remains private and secure on your device.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Widget Functionality:</strong> Our iOS widget displays financial summary data on your home screen. This data is shared between the main app and widget through iOS App Groups but remains entirely on your device. No widget data is transmitted externally.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Trial Period:</strong> Moneyflow offers a 72-hour free trial. Trial status is tracked locally on your device and is not shared with external services.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Your Information</h2>
        <p>Since Moneyflow does not collect any personal or usage data, we do not store, process, or share any information. All financial data and insights generated within the app remain solely on your device, ensuring complete user privacy.</p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>RevenueCat for Subscription Management:</strong> Moneyflow uses RevenueCat for subscription management and processing. RevenueCat may collect:</p>
        <ul>

        <p><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed through Apple's App Store. Apple may collect payment and purchase history data according to their privacy policy. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Analytics:</strong> Moneyflow does not use any third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics or similar tracking tools, to collect data about your app usage.</p>

        <h2>4. Security</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow prioritizes user privacy and data security. Since the app does not collect or store any personal information on external servers, there is no risk of unauthorized access, disclosure, or data breaches from our side. All financial data entered by the user is securely stored locally on the device and is not shared with third parties. <br><br> However, as with any application displaying sensitive information on-screen, we recommend that users take precautions to prevent unauthorized viewing by others while using the app. Additionally, since all data is stored locally, uninstalling the app will permanently delete all saved records.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Moneyflow does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete such information.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page with an updated "Last Update" date.</p>
